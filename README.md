## Hi there 🍵

A few things about me:
- Lover of type safety even if it's the fake TS kind
- Zed enjoyer, I just dislike the VSCode UI
- Spends too much time building tools around ▲

> Anyways not sure what you're doing here but have a look around, and feel free to 
checkout some of my projects, and ask for help if you have any issue with them.
