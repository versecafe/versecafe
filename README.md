## Hi there üçµ

I don't have much open source content on this profile so not sure how you got here but hi. I'm a developer with a passion for documentation, which may seem a little odd, but you ever join an OSS project, or start working for a new company, get into a repo and the extent of the documentation is just a `README.md` with the build command? It sucks, even if you're lucky enough to work on a project with decent documentation it can often be near impossible to parse all of it quickly inside larger code bases, due to this I've been focusing on ML search systems for `.md` & `.mdx` documentation.
