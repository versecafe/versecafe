- Zed enjoyer, I just dislike the VSCode UI
- Spends too much time building tools around ▲
- Came for |> & FP tricked into MVU (lustre)

> Anyways not sure what you're doing here but have a look around, and feel free to
> checkout some of my projects, and ask for help if you have any issue with them.
> Also my crowning acheivement, getting a user on one of my sites from AOL Desktop
