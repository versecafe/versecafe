## Hi there üçµ

I don't have much open source content on this profile so not sure how you got here but hi. I'm a developer with a passion for documentation, which may seem a little odd, but you ever join an OSS project, or start working for a new company, get into a repo and the extent of the documentation is just a `README.md` with the build command? 

It sucks.

Even if you're lucky enough to work on a project with decent documentation it can often be near impossible to parse all of it quickly inside larger code bases, due to this I've been focusing on ML search systems for `.md` & `.mdx` documentation.

*(also if you are reading this any advice on optimize similarity search on high dimensional vectors in large datasets T-SNE isn't great at perserving similarity information when dropping so many dimensions, and running a similarity sort over a cache of recent querries is kinda unreliable both as if a question generates a vector that is too similar it might not work but maybe since it's just passing in context windows and several of them at that it could be robust, honestly kinda a note to self at this point)*
